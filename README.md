# Thesis Explorations

Will contain code smells.

## Running the code

Make sure python 3.8 or higher is installed, then initialize a virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`, upgrade pip `pip install --upgrade pip` and install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Finally, setup the project to run using `python setup.py build` or `python setup.py develop` for development.

Then to run use `bng` for the basic naming game and `ang` for the autoencoder naming game. See `--help` for options.
