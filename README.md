# Thesis Explorations

Will contain code smells.

## Running the code

Make sure python 3.7 or higher is installed and initialize a virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`.<br>
Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`.<br>

Then upgrade pip `pip install --upgrade pip` and install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>
Finally, initialize the setup using `python setup.py build` or `python setup.py develop`.<br>

Then to run use `bng` for the basic naming game and `ang` for the autoencoder naming game. See `--help` for options.
